-- Eugene - I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. 
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM 
-- on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond - As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them 
-- for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning 
-- to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person 
-- on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
